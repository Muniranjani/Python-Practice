1. My notion of relationship is primarily based on the self. While the body plays a role in physical interactions and expressions of affection, the core of a relationship lies in the emotional and mental connection between individuals.

2. When I think about relationship, feelings are central. Emotions drive our connections with others, influencing how we perceive and interact with them. While physical sensations can enhance intimacy, it's the emotional bond that sustains a relationship.

3. I focus on ensuring these feelings within myself and expressing them to others. Authenticity and vulnerability are key in fostering meaningful connections. While receiving love and support from others is important, I believe in cultivating these emotions within oneself first.

4. I consider relationships both within and outside my family. Family relationships provide a foundation of support and understanding, but connections with friends, colleagues, and romantic partners also enrich my life and contribute to my personal growth.

5. Efforts in education to understand and practice relationships vary, but there's increasing recognition of their importance. Schools and colleges may offer courses on psychology, communication, and conflict resolution, but more emphasis on emotional intelligence and empathy could enhance relationship skills. Starting from home, parents can model healthy communication and empathy, while schools can incorporate social-emotional learning into curricula. In society, fostering inclusive communities and promoting mutual respect can contribute to a culture of positive relationships.




1. Trust is the belief or confidence in the reliability, integrity, and honesty of someone or something. It's the foundation of strong relationships, built over time through consistent actions and behaviors.

2. Trust can be present for a few individuals or for many, depending on the depth of the relationship and the experiences shared. While we may trust some people more than others, the capacity for trust isn't limited to just a select few.

3. Trust can be both conditional and unconditional. Conditional trust is based on specific criteria or circumstances, while unconditional trust is unwavering and not dependent on external factors. Both types have their place in different relationships and situations.

4. Trust can be maintained with certain individuals over time, but it's not guaranteed. It requires ongoing communication, transparency, and integrity from both parties to sustain trust in a relationship.

5. In my family and friends, I have unconditional, continuous trust in the intentions of a few individuals who have consistently demonstrated their integrity and reliability over the years. These relationships have been nurtured through mutual respect and understanding.

6. If I have unconditional, continuous trust in the intentions of someone but they lack competence, I would choose option (a): try to improve their competence while also enhancing my own. Constructive communication and support can help them develop their skills, fostering growth and strengthening the relationship. Getting irritated, angry, or feeling opposition would only hinder progress and strain the relationship.

v. Am I able to make myself always happy?
- While I strive to prioritize my happiness, I recognize that external factors and challenges may impact my emotional state at times.

vi. Am I able to make the other always happy?
- I understand that while I can contribute to the happiness of my family members, I cannot control their emotions entirely. I aim to support them but also respect their individual journeys.

vii. Is the other able to make himself/herself always happy?
- Each family member has their own agency in pursuing happiness, and I trust in their ability to navigate their own paths to fulfillment.

viii. Is the other able to make me always happy?

- My competence lies in my ability to communicate openly, provide support, and adapt to challenges within our relationships.

3. In case of getting angry/irritated:

a) Do I feel happy when I get angry? And when I express my anger?
- No, anger typically leads to feelings of frustration or regret, rather than happiness. Expressing anger may provide temporary relief, but it often leads to negative consequences in the long term.

b) What is the outcome when I express my anger? Is it mutual happiness?
- Expressing anger can strain relationships and create tension, often resulting in mutual unhappiness or resentment rather than resolution.

c) What is the reason for my anger? Is it the other or me?
- Anger often arises from a combination of internal and external factors, including misunderstandings, unmet expectations, or personal frustrations. It's important to reflect on the root cause of anger and address it constructively.

4. Reconnecting with Lost Friends:

I reach out to two close friends I've lost touch with due to lack of trust, expressing my desire to reconnect and mend our relationship. Their responses vary:

- Friend 1: Expresses gratitude for the gesture and reciprocates the desire to reconnect, acknowledging past challenges and expressing openness to rebuilding trust.
- Friend 2: Responds cautiously, expressing skepticism about the possibility of rebuilding trust and citing lingering doubts or concerns from past experiences. They appreciate the outreach but may need more time and communication to consider reconnecting fully.






I can't watch videos or access external content, but I can provide some general insights based on the questions you've provided.

1. **Story of Stuff Overview**:
   The Story of Stuff is a documentary that explores the materials economy, examining its motivation, process, and outcomes. It delves into the life cycle of goods, from extraction to disposal, highlighting issues such as overconsumption, environmental degradation, and social injustices.

2. **Impact on Bhutan**:
   The documentary may not specifically address Bhutan, but its themes likely resonate globally. Bhutan, with its emphasis on Gross National Happiness (GNH), could potentially be affected by the consumerist culture depicted in the film, leading to environmental and social challenges.

3. **Directors of the Drama**:
   The "Directors of the Drama" in the Story of Stuff could refer to the corporations, governments, and consumers involved in the materials economy. Whether they truly understand themselves and their ultimate goals is subjective. While some may prioritize profit and economic growth, others may prioritize sustainability and social well-being.

4. **Being Your Own Rulers**:
   To be one's own ruler in a world influenced by consumerism and materialism, individuals can practice mindful consumption, prioritize sustainability, and advocate for systemic change. By being conscious of their choices and their impact on the environment and society, individuals can exert agency over their lives.

Analyzing with respect to oneself and environment:

1. **Activities and Efforts**:
   Reflect on personal consumption habits, waste management practices, and efforts to reduce environmental impact. Are there similarities with the actions and initiatives depicted in the video? Consider ways to align personal behaviors with sustainability goals.

2. **Motivation by Notions of Happiness**:
   Evaluate whether personal consumption habits are driven by a notion of happiness linked to material possessions and physical facilities. Consider whether this notion is influenced by external factors such as advertisements or societal norms. Reflect on whether pursuing material wealth truly leads to lasting happiness or perpetuates a cycle of consumption.

3. **Notion of Happiness**:
   Reflect on personal notions of happiness. Are they shaped by individual values, experiences, and aspirations, or are they influenced by societal expectations? Consider whether happiness is equated solely with material wealth or if it encompasses broader aspects of well-being such as relationships, personal growth, and community involvement. Strive to cultivate a genuine understanding of happiness that aligns with personal values and fosters holistic well-being.





1. **Assumptions about Nature**:
   My assumptions about nature include viewing it as more than just a resource for human enjoyment. Nature encompasses complex ecosystems where every living being has a role to play. Human beings are part of this interconnected web, and we have a responsibility to act as stewards, fostering harmony and balance rather than exploitation.

2. **Interaction with Different Orders**:
   In a typical day, my interactions with the physical order might include breathing air, drinking water, and feeling the warmth of sunlight. With the bio order, I may consume food derived from plants and animals, and perhaps engage in activities like gardening or hiking. Interactions with the animal order could involve caring for pets or observing wildlife. In terms of the human order, interactions could range from communication with family and friends to engaging in societal structures like work or education. These interactions can involve giving and taking, appreciating, fulfilling responsibilities, and fostering mutual understanding.

3. **Contribution to Maintaining Harmony in Nature**:
   My family and I contribute to maintaining harmony in nature through various actions. This includes practicing sustainable living habits such as recycling, reducing waste, and conserving energy. We also prioritize supporting environmentally friendly initiatives, whether through advocacy, volunteering, or financially supporting conservation efforts. Additionally, we seek to educate ourselves and others about the importance of biodiversity and our interconnectedness with nature.

4. **Definite Conduct in Different Orders**:
   Yes, units of the physical order, bio order, and animal order exhibit definite conduct based on their natural inclinations and instincts. Similarly, when human behavior aligns with our natural inclinations and acceptance, it can lead to a more harmonious existence. Our natural acceptance encompasses innate desires for connection, well-being, and balance. When our actions align with these principles, they tend to be more sustainable and conducive to overall harmony within ourselves and with the broader natural world.
